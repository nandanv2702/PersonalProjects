# PersonalProjects

These are small projects that I made in order to make my life (or someone else's life) easier... and also because I was plain bored. Here's a list of all the projects I've worked on:

## Android Debug Bridge (ADB) Python script
[Link to Github Folder](https://github.com/nandanv2702/PersonalProjects/tree/master/adb-android) - I created a Python script to make it easier to install and uninstall apps on 10 android phones for Spark-A-Change Foundation. The phones will be given to underprivileged children who will use it for online classes. As it would take a long time and a lot of useless effort to manually download those 10 apps on every phone, I wrote this script that automatically installs the apps using the APKs that I downloaded online. It also uninstalls certain apps that we didn't need, so I created a script to show the names of the packages that we don't need [adb-diff.py](https://github.com/nandanv2702/PersonalProjects/tree/master/adb-android/adb-diff.py). So, all it takes it setting up the phone, connecting it to your laptop, and running this script using 'Python3 adb.py'!

## Lecture Video Tracker
[Link to Github Repo](https://github.com/nandanv2702/LectureVideoTracker) - a project I created using Python3 and a few modules in order to automatically scrape my stats professor's website to look for new lecture videos posted (made this during the coronavirus period so I don't need to constantly check for new lectures; the program notifies me if there's a new lecture).

## Video File Sorter
[Link to Github Repo](https://github.com/nandanv2702/VideoFileSorter) - used Python3 along with the OS module to automatically sort my video files between those shot on an iPhone vs those shot on my camera (Canon 700D).

## JavaScript Game - The Simon Game
[Link to Github Repo](https://github.com/nandanv2702/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Simon%20Game) - front-end web development project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to recreate the Simon Game

## 'Medium' Email Link Shortener
[Link to Github Repo](https://github.com/nandanv2702/PersonalProjects/blob/master/medium.py) - shell script that shortens a link to a Medium article that you receive in Medium's promotional emails. Helps bypass the 3 article a month limit (sometimes you need a paid subscription to read more, so I created this short program that just removes the "?source=email" part and everything after that so you can read as many articles. Run this program on your terminal as "python3 medium.py *link_goes_here*"
