# PersonalProjects

This repository has all of my personal projects uploaded in it. Here's a list of all the projects I've worked on (two of them are a separate repo as I haven't transferred the files to this repository):

* [Lecture Video Tracker](https://github.com/nandanv2702/LectureVideoTracker) - a project I created using Python3 and a few modules in order to automatically scrape my stats professor's website to look for new lecture videos posted (made this during the coronavirus period so I don't need to constantly check for new lectures; the program notifies me if there's a new lecture).
* [Video File Sorter](https://github.com/nandanv2702/VideoFileSorter) - used Python3 along with the OS module to automatically sort my video files between those shot on an iPhone vs those shot on my camera (Canon 700D).
* [Simon Game](https://github.com/nandanv2702/PersonalProjects/tree/master/Simon%20Game) - front-end web development project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to recreate the Simon Game
